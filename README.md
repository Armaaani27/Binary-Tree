# Binary Expression Tree Implementation in C++

**Description:**  
This project implements a **Binary Expression Tree (BET)** in C++, capable of constructing an expression tree from a postfix expression and performing operations such as printing infix and postfix expressions, counting nodes, and identifying leaf nodes. It demonstrates use of recursion, stack-based tree construction, and operator precedence handling.

**Tech Used:**  
C++ (C++11), Standard Template Library (STL) for optional supporting structures

**Key Features:**
- Build a binary expression tree from a postfix expression of integers.
- Print infix expressions with correct parentheses and operator precedence.
- Print postfix expressions.
- Calculate the total number of nodes and number of leaf nodes.
- Copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor implemented for proper memory management.
- Recursive implementation for tree traversal, size calculation, and tree cloning.
- Handles multi-digit operands and standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

Refer to the included Makefile for building and running.
